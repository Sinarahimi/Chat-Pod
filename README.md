# Pod-Async
A webSocket helepr that works with Fanap's POD Async service (DIRANA)

## Getting Started

This library allows you to connect to **Pod-Async** and use their services.

### Prerequisites

What things you need to Add this module to your project and after that set the `internet` permision in the manifest.

```<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET" />
```

 The first step is to create Async instance.


``` @Override
    protected void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) {
        super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);
        setContentView(R.layout.activity_main);

        Async async = Async.getInstance(context);
```

#The table below is the list of  methods defined in Async class

| Method                        | Description                                          |
|:------------------------------|:-----------------------------------------------------|
| `connect(socketServerAddress, appId, serverName, token)`         | Called when we want to connect to async. |
| `sendMessage(String textMessage, int messageType)`               | Called when we want to send a message.             |
| `getLiveState()`             | gets the state of the socket.           |
| `getState()`                |  gets the state of the socket.                |
| `getErrorMessage()`                 | gets the error of the async.        |
